### Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm Tony.. 1-part South African, 1-part Greek, 3-parts Programmer! Too many parts? ðŸ˜ƒ

I love coding, when I am not coding I am thinking about coding. Some say I am obsessed with clean code... they may be right!!

ðŸ”¥ I'm fortunate enough to have an awesome day job where I work as Director of Software Development at MMR Research. Constantly surounded by an amazing group of people, I get to work mostly on greenfield projects. I like to get my hands dirty and will typically spend about 60-70% of my time programming and architecting solutions, the rest is focused on leading, empowering and growing our Dev Team.

## Some of my OSS side projects:
- [TmdbEasy](https://github.com/tonykaralis/TmdbEasy) - Simple wrapper around The Movie Database Api
- nData - Test Data Framework.. coming soon
- rustysharp - Compilation of years worth of extension methods and helper classes.. coming soon

## Some bits about me:
* ðŸŒ± I'm constantly learning everyday.
* ðŸš´ I'm crazy about mountain biking and enjoy hiking with my fiancÃ©e (The Lakes are our favourite).
* ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help scalling out .NET core apps hosted on Azure Web App Services
* ðŸ“« You can contact me via [linked-in](www.linkedin.com/in/tony-karalis)
* ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
* âš¡ Fun fact: I have never lived continuously in 1 country for longer than 8 years ðŸ˜„

## Some bits I learnt along the way:
* Simplicity is key
* Think twice, code once
* Fundamentals matter, your Tech-stack doesn't
* Make sure you are always learning
* Spend most of your time outside of your comfort zone  

## Some languages & tools I work or have worked with:
* C#, C++, Javascript
* ASP.NET Framework and Core, QT
* PostgreSql, MSSql
* Vue.js, jQuery
* Git, SourceTree, Gitlab, Github, Azure DevOps, Azure, Docker
* HTML, CSS, SASS
